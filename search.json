    "text": "I’m not getting married any time soon (at least I don’t think I am), but I sometimes think about what my ideal wedding would be like. An important component of that vision is the wedding date. There’s a lot of factors that dictate a good wedding date, like venue and guest availability, but perhaps the most important is weather. Using publicly available Philadelphia weather data, I looked to determine which single date would be the best for me to get married in Philadelphia, given my weather and wedding type preferences.\nI’ve always thought an outdoor wedding would be cool, so it’s important that it does not rain on the day of my wedding. Thus, my first step in determining my ideal wedding day was finding which has been the dryest day in the last 20 years.\n\n#Set up\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n#Load the data\n\nweather_df = pd.read_csv('data/philadelphia_weather_2005_to_2025.csv')\nweather_df = weather_df.assign(date=pd.to_datetime(weather_df['date']))\n\n\n#Days in the data that have had no recorded rain\n\nno_rain = weather_df[weather_df[\"rain\"] == 0]\nprint(no_rain)\n\n              day  year  high  low  rain  snow       date  day_num  month_num  \\\n0       January 1  2005    64   39   0.0   0.0 2005-01-01        1          1   \n3       January 4  2005    55   44   0.0   0.0 2005-01-04        4          1   \n6       January 7  2005    43   36   0.0   0.0 2005-01-07        7          1   \n8       January 9  2005    40   37   0.0   0.0 2005-01-09        9          1   \n9      January 10  2005    50   34   0.0   0.0 2005-01-10       10          1   \n...           ...   ...   ...  ...   ...   ...        ...      ...        ...   \n7662  December 24  2025    51   36   0.0   0.0 2025-12-24       24         12   \n7663  December 25  2025    53   32   0.0   0.0 2025-12-25       25         12   \n7666  December 28  2025    42   26   0.0   0.0 2025-12-28       28         12   \n7668  December 30  2025    35   29   0.0   0.0 2025-12-30       30         12   \n7669  December 31  2025    35   27   0.0   0.0 2025-12-31       31         12   \n\n      dow   dow_name     month  \n0       5   Saturday   January  \n3       1    Tuesday   January  \n6       4     Friday   January  \n8       6     Sunday   January  \n9       0     Monday   January  \n...   ...        ...       ...  \n7662    2  Wednesday  December  \n7663    3   Thursday  December  \n7666    6     Sunday  December  \n7668    1    Tuesday  December  \n7669    2  Wednesday  December  \n\n[5137 rows x 12 columns]\n\n\n\n#Most commonly ocurring day in the subset\n\ndryest_day = no_rain[\"day\"].value_counts().idxmax()\nprint(dryest_day)\n\nAugust 26\n\n\n\n#Amount of times it has not rained on that day\n\ndryest_day_df = no_rain[no_rain[\"day\"] == dryest_day]\ncount = len(dryest_day_df)\nprint(count)\n\n21\n\n\nSince 2005, August 26th has been the dryest day, not recording a single day of rain. That’s great! But as a San Francisco native, I’ve grown up around moderate weather and don’t like it when it’s too hot or cold. So next, I wanted to find the average temperature on August 26th over the last 20 years.\n\n#Caluclating average temperature on August 26th\n\navg_temp = (dryest_day_df[\"high\"] + dryest_day_df[\"low\"]).mean() / 2\nprint(avg_temp)\n\n76.97619047619048\n\n\nThe average temperature on August 26th has been 77 degrees farenheight. That’s literally perfect. So save the date! If and when I get married in Philadelphia, it will be on August 26th."
