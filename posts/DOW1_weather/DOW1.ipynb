    "I'm not getting married any time soon (at least I don't think I am), but I sometimes think about what my ideal wedding would be like. An important component of that vision is the wedding date. There's a lot of factors that dictate a good wedding date, like venue and guest availability, but perhaps the most important is weather. Using publicly available Philadelphia weather data, I looked to determine which single date would be the best for me to get married in Philadelphia, given my weather and wedding type preferences."
